.. _model_McIntosh:

A Convolutional Retina Model
------------------------------

Use it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    import convis
    m = convis.models.McIntosh()
    m.cuda() # moving the model to the gpu if desired
    some_output = m.run(input, dt=100) # running the model

    # fitting the model to data
    m.set_optimizer.Adam()
    m.optimize(input, output, dt=100)

The chunk size `dt` depends on your the memory you have available.

The model has two convolution filters `layer1` and `layer2` and a linear `readout`. Since the size of the readout filter depends on the image size, it will be discarded if it does not match the image.

The parameters of the model are:

 * `layer1` the first convolution filter
    - `layer1.conv`
        + `layer1.conv.weight` with dimensions `8,1,time,x,y`
        + `layer1.conv.bias`
 * `layer2` the second convolution filter
    - `layer2.conv`
        + `layer2.conv.weight` with dimensions `16,8,time,x,y`
        + `layer2.conv.bias`
 * `readout`
    - `readout.weight` with dimensions `N, (16 * x * y)`
        + where `N` is the number of desired output channels

Between the layers, a rectifying non-linearity is applied,
but it does not have any parameters.



Build it yourself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lane McIntosh et al. published a paper in 2016 about a machine learning
approach to retinal modelling [1]. They used a convolutional neural network
to fit the responses of retinal ganglion cells.

The model is implemented in convis, but if you want to know how it works, 
you can follow this build-it-yourself recipie and built slight variations,
eg. a model that accepts color images or has additional layers.

First, let's start with importing the necessary libraries.

.. code-block:: python

    %matplotlib inline
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pylab as plt
    import convis
    import torch

The model by McIntosh et al. takes an input video and convolves it
in two stages and finally takes a dense linear filter to get a single
time course for each cell.

3d convolutions in PyTorch follow the convention of having
 
 * input dimensions: batch, input channels, time, space x, space y
 * output dimensions: batch, output channels, time, space x, space y
 * weight dimensions: input channels, output channels, time, space x, space y

For us, the batches are always 1 and for most models, the number of
input and output channels are 1 as well. However, since this is an
actual convolutional network, there will be more than one input and
output channel for each layer.

The first layer takes gray scale input and convolves it with 8 subunit
filters, resulting in a :py:`1, 8, time, space x, space y` output.

The second layer has 16 subunits, so it takes the 8 channels from the previous
layer and creates output with 16 channels from it.


So the computation that we want to do is the following:

.. code-block:: python

    # assuming we recieved some `the_input` variable
    activity = convolve_1(the_input)
    activity = relu(activity)
    activity = convolve_2(activity)
    activity = relu(activity)
    activity = linear_readout(activity)

Each of the convolution operations is not a stateless function,
but a convolutional layer that keeps track of its weights and states.
The `relu` (or some other activation function) can be found in the 
:py:module:`torch.nn.function` submodule.
And the readout is a Linear layer that combines the channels and
space together.

To create a model, we define a class that inherits from `convis.Layer`.
In its `__init__` function it has to create all the layers and parameters
that it's using and in its `forward` method, it just does exactly the
computation we outlined in pseudo code before.

.. code-block:: python

    class MyMcIntoshModel(convis.Layer):
        def __init__(self,filter_size=(10,5,5), random_init=True, out_channels=1, filter_2_size=(1,1,1)):
            super(MyMcIntoshModel,self).__init__()
            c1 = MemoryConv(1,8,filter_size)
            self.add_module('c1',c1)
            self.c1.conv.set_weight(1.0,normalize=True)
            if random_init:
                self.c1.conv.set_weight(rand(8,1,filter_size[0],filter_size[1],filter_size[2]),normalize=True)
            c2 = MemoryConv(8,16,filter_2_size)
            self.add_module('c2',c2)
            self.c2.conv.set_weight(1.0,normalize=True)
            if random_init:
                self.c2.conv.set_weight(rand(16,8,filter_2_size[0],filter_2_size[1],filter_2_size[2]),normalize=True)
            self.readout = convis.base.torch.nn.Linear(16,out_channels,bias=False)
        def forward(self, the_input):
            a = convis.base.torch.nn.functional.relu(self.c1(the_input))
            a = convis.base.torch.nn.functional.relu(self.c2(a))
            # The readout should consider all channels and all locations
            # so we need to reshape the Tensor such that the 4th dimension
            # contains dimensions 1,3 and 4
            #  - moving dimension 3 to 4:
            a = torch.cat(a.split(1,dim=3),dim=4)
            #  - moving dimension 1 to 4:
            a = torch.cat(a.split(1,dim=1),dim=4)
            if m.readout.weight.size()[-1] != a.size()[-1]:
                print 'Resetting weight'
                if self._use_cuda:
                    m.readout.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.ones((m.readout.weight.size()[0],a.size()[-1])))
                    m.readout.cuda()
                else:
                    m.readout.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.ones((m.readout.weight.size()[0],a.size()[-1])))
            a = self.readout(a)
            return a

Now that the model is defined, we can immediately use it and fit it to data.

.. code-block:: python

    m = MyMcIntoshModel(filter_size=(10,10,10))
    inp = convis.samples.moving_grating()*convis.samples.chirp()
    inp = convis.prepare_input(inp,cuda=True)
    o = m.run(inp, dt = 100)
    o.plot()

    m.set_optimizer.LBFGS([m.readout.weight])
    opt = m.optimize(inp,inp[:,:,:,:1,:1],dt=100)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    o = m.run(inp, dt = 100)
    plt.plot(inp.data.cpu().numpy()[0,0,:,0,0], lw=2)
    convis.plot_5d_time(o[0], mean = (0,1,3), lw=2)
    plt.xlabel('time')
    plt.ylabel('response')
    plt.legend(['target','model'])
