# Contributing to Convis

Bug reports and feature requests are always welcome!
The best place to put them is the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/jahuth/convis/issues).
If you have questions about usage of functions and classes and can not find 
an answer in the documentation and docstrings, this is considered a bug and I appreciate
it if you open an issue for that!

If you want, you can flag your issue already with one of the labels:

 * [bug](https://github.com/jahuth/convis/labels/bug)
 * [enhancement](https://github.com/jahuth/convis/labels/enhancement)
 * [missing documentation](https://github.com/jahuth/convis/labels/missing%20documentation)
 * [question](https://github.com/jahuth/convis/labels/question)

If you have fixed a bug or added a feature and you would like to see the change
included in the main repository, the preferred method is for you to commit the 
change to a fork on your own github account and submit a pull request.


General discussion is encouraged on the two mailing lists:
 * [convis-users@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/convis-users) for announcements and user questions
 * [convis-dev@googlegroups.com](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/convis-dev) for discussions about the development
