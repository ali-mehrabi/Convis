Quickstart:

 - I'm an experimentalist and I want to fit models to my data
 - I need some spikes that look like they came from the retina/LGN/V1/...
 - I



Fitting Data
------------

First, you need to get your data in a certain format:
 - videos or stimuli can be `time` by `x` by `y` numpy arrays, or `1` by `channel` by `time` by `x` by `y`.
 - all sequences have to have the same sampling frequency (bin-length)
 - if you want to fit a spike train and you only have the spike times, you need to convert them into a time sequence


.. code-block::
    python

    inp = np.zeros((10000,100,100))
    out = np.zeros(10000)

Then, you need to choose a model


Generating Spikes
-----------------



    .. plot::
        :include-source:

        import convis
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pylab as plt
        T,X,Y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(0.0,10.0,1000),
                        np.linspace(-2.0,2.0,20),
                        np.linspace(-2.0,2.0,20), indexing='ij')
        some_input = np.sin(T+X+Y)
        plt.matshow(some_input[3,:,:])
        plt.show()
        spk = convis.filters.spiking.LeakyIntegrateAndFireNeuron()
        spk.p.g_L = 10.0
        o = spk.run(some_input,dt=100)
        plt.figure()
        o.plot(mode='lines')
        plt.show()
